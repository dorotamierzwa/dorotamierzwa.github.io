  Hi! <br>
  <br>
  My name is Dorota and I'm a business graduate and work as a Product Consultant.
  I'm fascinated by data analysis and here is my place to learn the tools and build projects.<br>
<br>
	Currently my focus lies in statistics and its applications in Python. On a daily basis I work with SQL.
	After work I partipate in [PyLove](https://pylove.org/#/about) workshops.<br>
<br>
  Thanks for visiting and good luck to me!<br>
